# Module 7: Endpoint Security

## The Evolution of Endpoint Security

Traditionally, securing a network meant focusing on the perimeter with firewalls, VPNs, and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). Endpoints were company-owned computers residing within this protected LAN, secured by host-based antivirus, firewalls, and IPS software.

However, the modern workplace has shifted to a **Borderless Network**. The rise of Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD), remote work, and mobile access means the network perimeter is no longer clearly defined. This requires a more sophisticated, multi-layered approach to endpoint security that goes beyond the traditional model.

### Modern Endpoint Protection

Organizations must now protect a diverse range of endpoints against new threats using a combination of host-based and network-based measures.

| Measure | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Antimalware Software** | Protects endpoints from viruses, worms, and other malware. |
| **Spam Filtering** | Prevents malicious spam emails from ever reaching the endpoint. |
| **Blocklisting** | Prevents endpoints from connecting to websites with bad reputations by blocking them at the network level. |
| **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** | Prevents sensitive information from being copied, transferred, or stolen from the endpoint. |
| **Local Disk Encryption** | Protects data on a lost or stolen device from being accessed, using strong algorithms like 256-bit AES. |

## Modern Endpoint Protection Technologies

To secure the borderless network, security has shifted to include powerful network-based solutions that protect endpoints before a threat can even reach them.

  * **Advanced Malware Protection (AMP):** A network-level solution that detects, blocks, and analyzes malware across the network and endpoints.
  * **Email Security Appliance (ESA):** A device that filters emails to block spam, phishing attempts, and malicious attachments.
  * **Web Security Appliance (WSA):** A device that filters web traffic to enforce acceptable use policies and block access to malicious websites.
  * **Network Access Control (NAC):** A comprehensive system that acts as a gatekeeper to the network.

## Network Access Control (NAC)

The goal of NAC is to ensure that **only authorized and compliant devices are allowed to connect to the network**. It unifies endpoint security with user authentication and policy enforcement. For a company like **NexusAI**, NAC is critical for ensuring that any device connecting to their network—whether it's an employee laptop or a partner's machine—meets strict security standards before it can access sensitive patient data.

### Key NAC Capabilities:

  * **Profiling and Visibility:** Identifies users and devices as they connect, allowing policies to be applied before any damage can be done.
  * **Guest Network Access:** Provides a controlled, self-service portal for guest users that is isolated from the main corporate network.
  * **Security Posture Checking:** Evaluates connecting devices to ensure they comply with security policy (e.g., Is antivirus running and updated? Is the disk encrypted? Is the OS patched?).
  * **Incident Response:** Automatically blocks, isolates, or remediates non-compliant devices without administrator intervention.

## Port-Based Authentication with IEEE 802.1X

The **IEEE 802.1X** standard is a foundational technology for implementing NAC. It provides a mechanism to authenticate devices on a per-port basis before granting them access to the network.

### 802.1X Roles

There are three key components in an 802.1X transaction:

1.  **Supplicant (Client):** The endpoint device (e.g., a laptop or phone) that is requesting access. It must be running 802.1X-compliant software.
2.  **Authenticator (Switch):** The network device, typically a switch, that controls physical access to the network. It acts as a proxy, passing authentication messages between the supplicant and the authentication server.
3.  **Authentication Server (RADIUS Server):** The central server that performs the actual authentication. It validates the supplicant's credentials and tells the authenticator (switch) whether to grant or deny access.

### The 802.1X Authentication Process

The process uses the **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)** to exchange credentials. EAP messages are encapsulated in **EAP over LAN (EAPOL)** between the client and the switch, and in **RADIUS** between the switch and the authentication server.

### 802.1X Configuration on a Cisco Switch

Configuring 802.1X involves enabling AAA, defining the RADIUS server, and then applying the authentication method to the desired switch ports.

**Step-by-Step Configuration:**

1.  **Enable AAA globally.**
2.  **Configure the RADIUS server details** (IP address, shared key).
3.  **Define an 802.1X authentication method list** that uses the RADIUS server group.
4.  **Enable 802.1X globally.**
5.  **Configure the access interface:**
      * Set the port's authorization control to `auto` (enables 802.1X).
      * Set the Port Access Entity (PAE) type to `authenticator`.

```cli
! Step 1: Enable AAA
S1(config)# aaa new-model

! Step 2: Configure RADIUS Server
S1(config)# radius server NETSEC
S1(config-radius-server)# address ipv4 10.1.1.50 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813
S1(config-radius-server)# key RADIUS-Pa55w0rd
S1(config-radius-server)# exit

! Step 3: Create 802.1X Authentication Method
S1(config)# aaa authentication dot1x default group radius

! Step 4: Enable 802.1X Globally
S1(config)# dot1x system-auth-control

! Step 5 & 6: Configure the Interface
S1(config)# interface FastEthernet0/1
S1(config-if)# switchport mode access
S1(config-if)# authentication port-control auto
S1(config-if)# dot1x pae authenticator
```
