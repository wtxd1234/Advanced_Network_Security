# Module 9: ASA Firewall Configuration

## Introduction to the Cisco ASA

The Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) is a dedicated security device that combines firewall, VPN concentrator, and intrusion prevention capabilities into a single platform. While its Command Line Interface (CLI) has a similar look and feel to Cisco's IOS router software, there are key differences in commands and behavior.

### ASA CLI vs. IOS CLI

  * **Similarities:** The ASA CLI uses similar command prompts, supports command abbreviation, and uses the `Tab` key for completion and `?` for help.
  * **Key Differences:** Many common commands have different syntax. A significant difference is that on an ASA, commands like `show` can be executed from any configuration mode, not just privileged EXEC mode.

| IOS Router Command | Equivalent ASA Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| `enable secret` *`password`* | `enable password` *`password`* |
| `show ip interface brief` | `show interface ip brief` |
| `show ip nat translations` | `show xlate` |
| `copy running-config startup-config` | `write memory` |
| `erase startup-config` | `write erase` |

## Initial Device Configuration

Setting up an ASA involves configuring basic management settings, defining interfaces with security levels, and establishing connectivity.

### 1\. Basic Management Settings

These commands set the device's identity, secure privileged mode, and enable strong password encryption. Unlike IOS, which uses MD5 for the enable password, the ASA requires setting a master passphrase to enable strong AES encryption for all configured passwords.

```cli
! Enter global configuration mode
NETSEC-ASA# configure terminal

! Set hostname and domain name
NETSEC-ASA(config)# hostname ASA-FW
ASA-FW(config)# domain-name nexusai.local

! Set the enable password
ASA-FW(config)# enable password [your_strong_password]

! Configure a master key and enable strong AES password encryption
ASA-FW(config)# key config-key password-encryption [your_master_passphrase]
ASA-FW(config)# password encryption aes

! Configure a legal banner
ASA-FW(config)# banner motd ### UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS IS PROHIBITED ###

! Save the configuration
ASA-FW# write memory
```

### 2\. Configuring Interfaces and Security Levels

A fundamental concept of the ASA is the **security level**, a number from 0 (lowest trust) to 100 (highest trust) assigned to each interface. Traffic is permitted by default to flow from a **higher** security level interface to a **lower** one, but is **blocked** by default in the reverse direction.

  * **Outside (Internet):** Security Level 0
  * **Inside (LAN):** Security Level 100
  * **DMZ (Public Servers):** Any level between 1 and 99 (e.g., 50)

This default behavior is perfect for an organization like **NexusAI**, allowing their internal users (Inside) to access the internet (Outside), but automatically blocking any unsolicited traffic from the internet trying to access their private network.

```cli
! Configure the OUTSIDE interface
ASA-FW(config)# interface gigabitethernet1/1
ASA-FW(config-if)# nameif OUTSIDE
INFO: Security level for "OUTSIDE" set to 0 by default.
ASA-FW(config-if)# ip address 209.165.200.225 255.255.255.252
ASA-FW(config-if)# no shutdown

! Configure the INSIDE interface
ASA-FW(config-if)# interface gigabitethernet1/2
ASA-FW(config-if)# nameif INSIDE
INFO: Security level for "INSIDE" set to 100 by default.
ASA-FW(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
ASA-FW(config-if)# no shutdown
```

### 3\. Configuring a Default Route

To give the ASA internet connectivity, a default static route must be configured pointing to the next-hop ISP router.

```cli
ASA-FW(config)# route OUTSIDE 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 209.165.200.226
```

## Simplifying Policy with Object Groups

Object groups are a powerful feature that makes ASA configurations cleaner and easier to manage. They are reusable components that represent a collection of IP addresses, protocols, or port numbers.

  * **Network Object:** Represents a single host, a subnet, or a range of IP addresses.
  * **Service Object:** Represents a protocol, a specific TCP/UDP port, or a range of ports.

By creating object groups, you can write a single ACL or NAT rule that applies to many hosts or services at once. For example, **NexusAI** could create a network object group named `PARTNER_HOSPITALS` containing the IP subnets of all their clients, simplifying access rules.

```cli
! Create a network object group for Admin hosts
ASA-FW(config)# object-group network ADMIN-HOSTS
ASA-FW(config-network-object-group)# network-object host 192.168.1.10
ASA-FW(config-network-object-group)# network-object host 192.168.1.11

! Create a service object group for standard web traffic
ASA-FW(config)# object-group service WEB-SERVICES tcp
ASA-FW(config-service-object-group)# port-object eq http
ASA-FW(config-service-object-group)# port-object eq https
```

-----

## Configuring ASA Access Control Lists (ACLs)

ASA ACLs are used to override the default security-level behavior and create granular traffic policies.

### Key Differences from IOS ACLs:

  * They are **always named**; there are no numbered ACLs.
  * They use standard **network masks** (e.g., `255.255.255.0`), not wildcard masks.
  * The `access-group` command is used to apply them to an interface.

The true power of ASA ACLs is realized when they are combined with object groups. A single, easy-to-read rule can replace dozens of individual lines of configuration.

```cli
! This single ACL rule uses the object groups created earlier.
! It permits hosts in the ADMIN-HOSTS group to access any destination
! using standard web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS).

ASA-FW(config)# access-list ADMIN_WEB_ACCESS extended permit object-group WEB-SERVICES object-group ADMIN-HOSTS any

! Apply the ACL inbound on the INSIDE interface
ASA-FW(config)# access-group ADMIN_WEB_ACCESS in interface INSIDE
```

## Configuring Network Address Translation (NAT)

The ASA uses an object-based approach to configure NAT, which is more intuitive than traditional IOS NAT.

  * **Dynamic PAT (Overload):** Translates many internal private IP addresses to the single public IP address of the outside interface. This is the most common form of NAT for allowing internal users to access the internet.

    ```cli
    ! Define the internal network to be translated
    ASA-FW(config)# object network INSIDE-NET
    ASA-FW(config-network-object)# subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

    ! Configure PAT for this network when traffic goes from INSIDE to OUTSIDE
    ASA-FW(config-network-object)# nat (INSIDE,OUTSIDE) dynamic interface
    ```

  * **Static NAT:** Creates a one-to-one mapping between an internal private IP address and an external public IP address. This is essential for making an internal server (e.g., a web server in a DMZ) accessible from the internet.

    ```cli
    ! Define the internal DMZ server
    ASA-FW(config)# object network DMZ-WEB-SERVER
    ASA-FW(config-network-object)# host 192.168.2.100

    ! Create a static one-to-one NAT mapping to a public IP address
    ASA-FW(config-network-object)# nat (DMZ,OUTSIDE) static 209.165.200.230
    ```
