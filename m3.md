# Module 3: Mitigating Network Threats

## The Human & Conceptual Elements of Defense

Effective threat mitigation starts with knowledgeable professionals and foundational security principles. It's not just about technology; it's about people, policies, and principles.

### The Role of the Network Security Professional

Network security professionals are responsible for ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and overall data assurance of an organization's information. To stay ahead of attackers, they must engage in continuous learning by:

  * Constantly upgrading their skill sets.
  * Attending training and workshops.
  * Subscribing to real-time threat intelligence feeds.
  * Keeping up-to-date with security websites and organizations.

### Key Network Intelligence Communities

Staying informed is critical. The following organizations provide invaluable resources, threat intelligence, and community support for security professionals:

| Organization | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SANS Institute** | Offers a vast library of free resources, including the Internet Storm Center (an early warning system), security alerts, research papers, and professional training courses. |
| **Mitre** | A non-profit that maintains the globally recognized list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), which is a cornerstone for cybersecurity threat identification. |
| **FIRST** | The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams fosters cooperation and information sharing among security teams from government, commercial, and educational sectors. |
| **(ISC)²** | A global, vendor-neutral organization that provides education and career services and offers highly respected security certifications. |
| **CIS** | The Center for Internet Security is a focal point for cyber threat prevention and response, particularly for state and local governments. |

### The CIA Triad: The Foundation of Information Security

The CIA Triad is a core model that forms the basis of all security policies and actions. It consists of three essential components:

  * **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information. For a company like NexusAI, this means guaranteeing that patient health data is completely private.
  * **Integrity:** Protecting data from unauthorized alteration or modification. This ensures the accuracy and trustworthiness of information.
  * **Availability:** Guaranteeing that authorized users have uninterrupted access to the data and resources they need to do their jobs.

## Establishing a Defensive Posture: Policies & Procedures

A strong security posture is built on a framework of clear, enforceable policies that govern the actions of people and systems.

### Security Policies

A formal security policy informs all stakeholders of the organization's requirements for protecting its information assets. It provides a baseline for configuring systems, auditing compliance, and defining behavior. Key components include:

  * **Identification and Authentication Policy:** Specifies who can access resources and how their identity will be verified.
  * **Password Policy:** Enforces password complexity, length, and rotation schedules.
  * **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):** Defines what users are permitted to do on the network and the consequences for violations.
  * **Remote Access Policy:** Governs how remote users connect to the network and what they can access.
  * **Incident Handling Procedures:** Outlines the step-by-step plan for responding to a security breach.

### BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policies

Supporting employee-owned devices increases risk. A strong BYOD policy is essential to mitigate vulnerabilities. Best practices include:

  * Enforcing password-protected access on all devices.
  * Requiring users to manually control Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, connecting only to trusted networks.
  * Mandating that device operating systems and software are always kept up-to-date.
  * Enabling remote backup and "Find My Device" services with a remote wipe feature.
  * Using **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** software to enforce security settings and configurations on all devices that connect to company resources.

## Defense-in-Depth: Tools, Platforms, and Services

The modern approach to security involves layering multiple defenses, a concept often visualized as a "security onion." An attacker must penetrate multiple layers—such as firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and authentication—to reach the core assets.

However, with the rise of borderless networks and cloud services, this model is evolving into the "security artichoke," where attackers may only need to peel back a few specific "leaves" (like a weak password or a web application vulnerability) to get to the heart of the network.

### Security Platforms and Services

To manage the complexity of modern threats, organizations rely on integrated platforms and services:

  * **Data Security Platforms (DSPs):** Solutions like Cisco SecureX integrate tools for event management, threat detection, and automated incident response into a single dashboard, providing a unified view of the security landscape.
  * **Threat Intelligence Services:** Services like the **Cisco Talos Threat Intelligence Group** are crucial. Talos is one of the world's largest commercial threat intelligence teams, collecting and analyzing data on emerging threats to provide real-time protection to subscribers. This intelligence automatically updates security devices with the latest firewall rules and indicators of compromise.

## Practical Mitigation Techniques for Common Attacks

Here are specific strategies for defending against different types of attacks.

### Mitigating Malware

  * **Antivirus Software:** Essential for preventing hosts from getting infected. It must be installed on all endpoints and, critically, be configured for automatic updates to receive the latest virus definitions.
  * **Perimeter Filtering:** Use security devices at the network edge to identify and block known malware files before they can enter the network.

### Mitigating Worms

Responding to a network-based worm attack requires a coordinated, four-phase approach:

| Phase | Response |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Containment** | Immediately segment the network using ACLs on routers and firewalls to limit the spread of the worm to already-affected areas. |
| **2. Inoculation** | Patch all uninfected systems to remove the vulnerability the worm exploits, thus depriving it of new targets. |
| **3. Quarantine** | Identify, disconnect, and isolate all infected machines within the contained areas. |
| **4. Treatment** | Disinfect the quarantined machines by terminating the worm process, removing modified files, or, if necessary, completely reinstalling the system. |

### Mitigating Reconnaissance Attacks

While impossible to stop completely, these information-gathering attacks can be limited:

  * Use a firewall and IPS to limit the information an attacker can discover with a port scanner.
  * Implement strong authentication and encryption to render packet sniffing useless.
  * Turn off ICMP echo/reply on edge routers to block ping sweeps, but be aware this also limits network diagnostic capabilities.

### Mitigating Access & DoS Attacks

  * **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong password policies and use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible. Disable accounts after a set number of failed login attempts.
  * **Antispoofing Technologies:** Use features like DHCP Snooping, IP Source Guard, and ACLs to prevent attackers from using spoofed IP addresses to launch attacks.
  * **Principle of Minimum Trust:** Grant users and systems only the minimum level of access required for their function.
  * **Patch Management:** Keep all operating systems and applications fully patched to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
  * **User Education:** Train employees to recognize and report social engineering attempts.
