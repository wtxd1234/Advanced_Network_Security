# Module 2: Understanding Network Threats

## The Adversaries: Who is Attacking Our Networks?

To build a strong defense, we must first understand the fundamental concepts of risk and the nature of those who pose a threat.

### Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk

  * **Threat:** The potential for a vulnerability to be exploited.
  * **Vulnerability:** A weakness in a system or its design that can be exploited by a threat.
  * **Risk:** The potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

Organizations typically adopt one of four strategies to manage risk:

| Risk Management Strategy | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Acceptance** | Accepting the risk without taking action because the cost of mitigation outweighs the potential loss. |
| **Risk Avoidance** | Eliminating the risk by ceasing the activity or removing the device that poses the risk. |
| **Risk Reduction** | The most common strategy; taking steps to decrease the risk's impact or likelihood. |
| **Risk Transfer** | Shifting the financial burden of the risk to a third party, such as an insurance company. |

### Types of Threat Actors

The landscape of attackers has evolved significantly over time. While the term "hacker" is common, it's more precise to use "threat actor" and classify them by their motivations and capabilities.

| Threat Actor | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Script Kiddies** | Inexperienced attackers who use existing scripts and tools developed by others to cause harm, typically not for profit. |
| **Vulnerability Brokers** | Grey hat hackers who discover and report vulnerabilities to vendors, sometimes for rewards. |
| **Hacktivists** | Grey hat hackers who use their skills to protest against political or social ideas. |
| **Cybercriminals** | Black hat hackers motivated by financial gain. They may work alone or for large criminal organizations, stealing billions of dollars annually. |
| **State-Sponsored** | Attackers who work for a government to steal secrets, gather intelligence, and sabotage the networks of other nations or corporations. |

## The Arsenal: Threat Actor Tools & Techniques

Over the years, the tools used for cyberattacks have become significantly more sophisticated and automated, while the technical knowledge required to use them has decreased.

Threat actors and security professionals use a wide variety of tools, which can be grouped into several categories:

  * **Password Crackers:** Tools like John the Ripper and THC Hydra that attempt to guess passwords.
  * **Wireless Hacking Tools:** Tools like Aircrack-ng used to exploit vulnerabilities in wireless networks.
  * **Network Scanning & Hacking Tools:** Tools like Nmap and Angry IP Scanner used to probe networks for open ports and active devices.
  * **Packet Crafting Tools:** Used to create forged packets to test firewall and system robustness.
  * **Packet Sniffers:** Tools like Wireshark that capture and analyze network traffic.
  * **Rootkit Detectors:** Checksum verifiers used to detect hidden rootkits on a system.
  * **Fuzzers:** Tools that input invalid or random data into a system to find security vulnerabilities.
  * **Forensic Tools:** Used to find traces of evidence left behind on a system after an attack.
  * **Debuggers:** Used to reverse-engineer binary files to analyze malware or find exploits.
  * **Hacking Operating Systems:** Specialized OSs like Kali Linux and Parrot OS that come pre-loaded with hacking tools.
  * **Vulnerability Exploitation Tools:** Frameworks like Metasploit used to launch attacks against known vulnerabilities.
  * **Vulnerability Scanners:** Tools like Nessus and OpenVAS that scan systems for known weaknesses.

## Malicious Software (Malware)

Malware is any software or code specifically designed to damage, disrupt, or steal data from a host or network. The three most common types are viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.

### Viruses

A virus is malware that spreads by inserting a copy of itself into another program. It requires human assistance to spread, such as a user running an infected executable file or opening a malicious document. Most viruses are now spread via email, network shares, and removable media like USB drives.

### Trojan Horses

A Trojan horse is malware disguised as legitimate software. A user is tricked into installing it, often as part of an online game or utility. Once running, the Trojan horse can perform malicious actions in the background, such as providing remote access to the attacker, sending sensitive data like passwords (a critical threat for a company like NexusAI handling patient data), or deleting files.

| Type of Trojan Horse | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Remote-access** | Enables unauthorized remote control over the victim's computer. |
| **Data-sending** | Steals sensitive data like passwords or credit card numbers. |
| **Destructive** | Corrupts or deletes files. |
| **Proxy** | Uses the victim's computer to launch attacks on other targets. |
| **Security software disabler** | Stops antivirus or firewall programs from working. |
| **Keylogger** | Records the victim's keystrokes to steal confidential information. |

### Worms

Worms are similar to viruses in that they replicate and cause damage, but with a key difference: they can spread by themselves without any human interaction. Worms exploit vulnerabilities in networks to travel from system to system, often with devastating speed. The infamous SQL Slammer worm infected over 250,000 servers in just 30 minutes.

Most worms have three main components:

1.  **Enabling Vulnerability:** The security flaw the worm uses to install itself.
2.  **Propagation Mechanism:** The method it uses to find and infect new targets.
3.  **Payload:** The malicious code that performs the ultimate action, like creating a backdoor or launching a DoS attack.

### Other Common Malware

  * **Ransomware:** Currently the most profitable and dominant form of malware. It encrypts a victim's files and demands a payment (usually in cryptocurrency) to restore access.
  * **Spyware:** Gathers information about a user without their consent.
  * **Adware:** Displays pop-up ads to generate revenue for its author.
  * **Scareware:** Deceives users with fake threat notifications to persuade them into installing more malware.
  * **Phishing:** Attempts to trick people into divulging sensitive information through deceptive emails or websites.
  * **Rootkits:** Hides deep within a computer's operating system to conceal the attacker's presence and maintain privileged access.

## The Attack Lifecycle: A Three-Pronged Approach

Network attacks can be broadly classified into three major categories that often follow a logical sequence: Reconnaissance, Access, and Denial of Service.

### 1\. Reconnaissance Attacks

This is the information-gathering phase, where an attacker performs unauthorized discovery and mapping of target systems to find vulnerabilities. The typical steps are:

1.  **Information Query:** Using public tools like Google and `whois` to find initial information.
2.  **Ping Sweep:** Identifying which IP addresses on the target network are active.
3.  **Port Scan:** Determining which services (e.g., web, email) are running on the active devices.
4.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Querying the open ports to identify the application and OS versions and find known weaknesses.
5.  **Exploitation Research:** Finding or developing a tool to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.

### 2\. Access Attacks

This is the "break-in" phase, where an attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access.

| Access Attack Technique | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Password Attacks** | Attempts to discover system passwords through guessing, brute force, or other methods. |
| **Spoofing Attacks** | Falsifying data to impersonate another device (e.g., IP spoofing, MAC spoofing). |
| **Trust Exploitation** | Using a compromised system's trusted position to attack other systems on the same network. |
| **Port Redirection** | Using a compromised system as a pivot point to attack other targets. |
| **Man-in-the-Middle** | Intercepting and potentially altering communications between two parties without their knowledge. |

### 3\. Social Engineering

Social engineering is a special type of access attack that targets the weakest link in security: humans. It uses manipulation to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions they shouldn't.

| Social Engineering Technique | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pretexting** | Inventing a scenario (a pretext) to persuade a victim to provide information. |
| **Phishing / Spear Phishing** | Using fraudulent emails to trick recipients. Spear phishing is a highly targeted version aimed at a specific person or organization. |
| **Baiting** | Leaving a malware-infected flash drive in a public place for a curious victim to find and use. |
| **Something for Something** | Offering a gift or service in exchange for private information. |
| **Impersonation** | Pretending to be someone else (e.g., a help desk technician) to gain trust. |
| **Tailgating** | Following an authorized person into a secure location. |
| **Shoulder Surfing** | Looking over someone's shoulder to steal passwords or other information. |
| **Dumpster Diving** | Rummaging through trash to find confidential documents. |

## Advanced Attacks & Evasion

### Denial-of-Service (DoS) and DDoS Attacks

A DoS attack's goal is to interrupt network services by either overwhelming a target with traffic or sending maliciously formatted packets that cause it to crash.

A **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)** attack is much larger in scale, originating from thousands of compromised computers (known as **zombies** or **bots**) that are all part of a **botnet**, controlled by a **botmaster**. This makes DDoS attacks extremely difficult to stop.

### Buffer Overflow Attack

This attack exploits a common programming flaw. The attacker sends more data to a memory buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overwrite adjacent memory. This can crash the system or, in some cases, allow the attacker to execute malicious code.

### Evasion Methods

Threat actors use various methods to hide their attacks from security systems like firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).

| Evasion Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Encryption & Tunneling** | Hiding malware or stolen data inside of encrypted or legitimate-looking traffic. |
| **Resource Exhaustion** | Making a security device so busy that it can't properly inspect traffic. |
| **Traffic Fragmentation** | Splitting a malicious payload into many small packets that are reassembled after bypassing security. |
| **Pivoting** | Using a compromised host inside a network to launch deeper attacks from a trusted position. |
