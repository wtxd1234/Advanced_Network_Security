**Question 4: Sunway Medical Centre is conducting an audit in several risk areas within a critical corporation. What statement describes an attack vector?**

An attack vector is the **path or method** a threat actor uses to gain unauthorized access to a network or system to deliver a malicious payload. Examples include a phishing email, an unpatched software vulnerability, or a compromised USB drive.

---

**Question 5: Which security way to control of a reconnaissance attack from within our campus network?**

Implement an **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** to monitor internal network traffic for scanning patterns and block them. Additionally, using **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** on switches and routers can restrict traffic between different network segments (e.g., preventing the student network from scanning the administrative network).

---

**Question 6: Which attack involves threat actors positioning themselves between a source and destination with the intent of transparently monitoring, capturing, and controlling the communication?**

This is a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack.

---

**Question 7: What is the motivation of a white hat attacker?**

A white hat attacker (or ethical hacker) is motivated to **find and fix security vulnerabilities** before malicious attackers can exploit them. They work with organizations to improve security.

---

**Question 8: A network administrator is configuring an AAA server to manage TACACS+ authentication. Which one is true?**

A key true statement is that **TACACS+ encrypts the entire packet payload**, providing more security than RADIUS, which only encrypts the password. Another true statement is that TACACS+ separates the processes of Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.

---

**Question 9: Which of the following encryption algorithms is most vulnerable to brute force attacks?**

Older algorithms with short key lengths are the most vulnerable. **DES (Data Encryption Standard)** is a classic example because it uses a small 56-bit key, which can be cracked by modern computers relatively easily.

---

**Question 10: What is the purpose of a reconnaissance attack on a computer network?**

The purpose is to **gather information** about a target. The attacker discovers active hosts, open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities to plan for a future, more direct attack.

---

**Question 11: A security service company is conducting an audit in several risk areas within a major corporation. What statement describes an internal threat?**

An internal threat is a security risk that originates from **within the organization**. This could be a malicious employee stealing data or a careless employee accidentally causing a data breach.

---

**Question 12: Which condition describes the potential threat created by Instant On in a data center?**

The threat is that a virtual machine can be powered on using an **outdated or unpatched template**. This makes the new VM instantly vulnerable to attacks before security policies and updates can be applied.

---

**Question 13: A security service company is conducting an audit in several risk areas within a major corporation. What statement describes the risk of using social networking?**

The risk is that employees might inadvertently leak sensitive personal or company information online. Attackers can gather this information to launch targeted **social engineering or phishing attacks**.

---

**Question 14: A company has several sales offices distributed within a city. Each sales office has a SOHO network. What is the security features that are commonly found in such a network configuration?**

Common features include a **basic firewall**, **Network Address Translation (NAT)**, **Wi-Fi encryption (WPA2/WPA3)**, and a password-protected administrator interface for the router.

---

**Question 15: Which security feature or device would more likely be used within an to protect attack from external?**

A **Firewall** is the primary device used at the network edge to filter traffic and protect against external attacks.

---

**Question 16: A user is curious about how someone might know a computer has been infected with malware. List one common malware behavior.**

One common behavior is the **computer running significantly slower** than usual, freezing, or crashing unexpectedly.

---

**Question 17: What commonly motivates cybercriminals to attack networks as compared to hactivists or state-sponsored hackers?**

Cybercriminals are primarily motivated by **financial gain** (money). In contrast, hacktivists are driven by a political or social cause, and state-sponsored hackers work for national interests.

---

**Question 18: What occurs after RSA keys are generated on a Cisco router to prepare for secure device management?**

Generating RSA keys **automatically enables the SSH server** on the router, making it ready to accept secure connections.

---

**Question 19: What is the primary method for mitigating malware?**

Using up-to-date **Antivirus and Antimalware software**. This software is designed to detect, block, and remove malicious programs.

---

**Question 20: An online retailer needs a service to support the nonrepudiation of the transaction. Which component is used for this service?**

**Digital Signatures** are used for nonrepudiation. They provide proof that a specific person sent a message or authorized a transaction and cannot deny it later.

---

**Question 21: Define a buffer overflow?**

A buffer overflow is a vulnerability that occurs when a program attempts to write more data into a memory buffer (a fixed-size container) than it can hold. The excess data overflows, corrupting adjacent memory, which can cause the program to crash or allow an attacker to execute malicious code.

---

**Question 22: Which security policy characteristic defines the need of standards?**

A policy must be **enforceable**. To be enforceable, there must be clear standards and guidelines that specify exactly how to comply with the high-level policy rules.

---

**Question 23: What type of algorithms require sender to exchange a secret key that is used to ensure the confidentiality of data delivered?**

**Symmetric key algorithms** (e.g., AES, DES). These algorithms use the same single key for both encryption and decryption.

---

**Question 24: What is the assurances does digital signing provide about code that is downloaded from the Internet?**
1.  **Integrity:** The code has not been tampered with or altered since it was signed.
2.  **Authenticity:** The code genuinely originates from the publisher who signed it.

---

**Question 25: What algorithm can be part of an IPsec policy to provide hashing to protect interesting traffic?**

**SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)**, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, is a modern algorithm used for hashing in IPsec to ensure data integrity. (MD5 is an older, less secure alternative).

---

**Question 26: A security awareness session is best suited for which topic?**

Topics like **how to identify phishing emails** or **recognizing social engineering tactics** are perfect for a general security awareness session.

---

**Question 27: What is a characteristic of most modern viruses?**

They are often **polymorphic**, meaning the virus changes its own code each time it infects a new system. This makes it harder for signature-based antivirus software to detect it.

---

**Question 28: What is a secure configuration option for remote access to a network device?**

Using **SSH (Secure Shell)** for encrypted command-line access and disabling insecure protocols like Telnet.

---

**Question 29: Which type of hackers are typically classified as grey hat hacker?**

A grey hat hacker is someone who finds vulnerabilities in a system without permission, but they do not have malicious intent. They might report the flaw to the owner or publicize it, operating in an ethical "grey area."

---

**Question 30: Which ONE option provide secure remote access to a router?**

**SSH (Secure Shell)** provides an encrypted, secure command-line connection for remote management.

---

**Question 31: A company is implementing a VPN solution... Which feature of IPsec should they enable to achieve this?**

**Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**. This feature ensures that a new, unique session key is generated for each session. If one key is compromised, it cannot be used to decrypt past or future sessions.

---

**Question 32: A network administrator notices that a switch in the network is behaving abnormally... What type of attack is this, and how can it be mitigated?**

* **Attack:** This is a **MAC Flooding Attack**.
* **Mitigation:** Enable **Port Security** on the switch. This feature can limit the number of MAC addresses allowed on a port and shut the port down if an attacker tries to exceed that limit.

---

**Question 33: A financial institution requires secure remote access... What security measures can they implement to mitigate this risk?**
1.  **Disable password authentication** and use **Public Key Authentication**, which is much stronger and not vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
2.  Install software like **`fail2ban`**, which automatically blocks IP addresses that have too many failed login attempts.

---

**Question 34: A company is deploying a centralized authentication system... Which protocol should they choose, and why?**

They should choose **TACACS+**.
* **Why:** TACACS+ provides granular control by separating authorization from authentication, allowing administrators to control exactly which commands a user can run. It also encrypts the entire packet body, making it more secure than RADIUS.

---

**Question 35: A security analyst is investigating a potential breach... How does public key authentication enhance security in this scenario?**

Public key authentication requires a user to possess a private cryptographic key, which is a very long, complex file. This is far more secure than a password because the key cannot be easily guessed, stolen, or brute-forced like a password can.

---

**Question 36: A network administrator is configuring a firewall to protect the internal network... What type of firewall rule should they implement to achieve this?**

They should implement a **"default deny"** policy. This involves creating an explicit rule at the end of the list to block all incoming traffic, with specific "permit" rules placed before it to allow only HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic.

---

**Question 37: An attacker is attempting to exploit a vulnerability in a web application by injecting malicious SQL queries... What security measure should they implement to mitigate this threat?**

They should use **Prepared Statements (or Parameterized Queries)**. This technique separates the SQL command from the user data, ensuring that user input is treated as data only and cannot be executed as a malicious command.

---

**Question 38: A network administrator is troubleshooting a VPN connection between two offices... What is the best way to resolve this issue?**

The best way to resolve this is to **ensure the IPsec/VPN configurations on both devices are identical**. This includes the encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256), hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256), Diffie-Hellman group, and authentication method.

---

**Question 39: A network administrator is tasked with securing the company's wireless network... What is the primary role of the RADIUS server in this authentication process?**

The RADIUS server acts as the **Authentication Server**. It receives the user's credentials from the switch or access point, verifies them against its database, and then tells the network device whether to grant or deny access to the user.

---

**Question 40: A company is configuring its firewall... What type of firewall configuration should they implement to achieve this?**

They should implement a **Stateful Firewall**. A stateful firewall tracks active connections, allowing employees to initiate connections to the internet and automatically permitting the return traffic for those sessions, while blocking all other unsolicited incoming traffic.
