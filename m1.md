# Module 1: Securing Networks

## The Modern Threat Landscape

In today's interconnected world, networks are the backbone of commerce, communication, and innovation. From smart cities powered by IoT to healthcare analytics platforms like NexusAI processing sensitive patient data, the reliability and integrity of these networks are paramount. However, their very importance makes them prime targets for attack.

Networks are under a constant barrage of attacks from threat actors around the globe. This isn't a rare occurrence; it's a continuous, 24/7 reality, as visualized by real-time threat maps. A security breach is not just a technical issue; it can disrupt e-commerce, lead to the catastrophic loss of business data, violate personal privacy, and compromise the integrity of critical information.

## Understanding Attack & Data Loss Vectors

To defend a network, you must first understand how it can be attacked.

### Attack Vectors

An **attack vector** is the path or means by which a threat actor gains unauthorized access to a network or server to deliver a malicious payload. These vectors can originate from two primary directions:

* **External Threats:** These originate from outside the corporate network, typically over the internet. A common goal is to create a Denial of Service (DoS) attack to disrupt operations.
* **Internal Threats:** These originate from within the network, often from a compromised host or a malicious insider.

*Visual representation of how external threats are filtered by a firewall, while internal threats operate from within the trusted network.*

### Data Loss Vectors

Data loss is one of the most significant consequences of a security breach. It can occur through various channels, each requiring specific controls to mitigate.

| Vector | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Email/Social Networking** | This is one of the most common vectors for data loss, where confidential information can be revealed through intercepted emails or instant messages. |
| **Unencrypted Devices** | A stolen corporate laptop containing confidential data is a major risk. If the data is not encrypted, a thief can easily access it. |
| **Cloud Storage** | While beneficial, cloud services can become a vulnerability. Sensitive data can be lost if an account is compromised due to weak security settings. |
| **Removable Media** | An employee could make an unauthorized data transfer to a USB drive, or a drive containing valuable corporate data could simply be lost. |
| **Hard Copy** | Physical documents matter. Discarded reports that haven't been properly shredded can be retrieved by an attacker to gain valuable information. |
| **Improper Access Control** | Weak or stolen passwords are a primary line of defense. If compromised, they can provide an attacker with easy access to sensitive data. |

## Defense-in-Depth for Network Topologies

There is no single solution to network security. A robust strategy involves a layered approach, known as "defense-in-depth," tailored to the specific type of network being protected.

### Campus Area Network (CAN)

A CAN, typical of a corporate or university environment, requires a comprehensive, multi-layered defense.

* **ASA Firewall:** A Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) acts as the gatekeeper, performing stateful packet filtering to block unwanted external traffic.
* **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Protects data in motion as it travels from the campus to the outside world, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity from authenticated sources.
* **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):** Actively monitors incoming and outgoing traffic for malicious activity, attempting to block threats and report them.
* **Email & Web Security (ESA/WSA):** A Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Web Security Appliance (WSA) provide advanced threat defense specifically for email and web traffic.
* **AAA Server:** Manages Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting to authenticate users, authorize their actions, and track what they are doing.
* **Layer 3 & 2 Switches:** These internal network devices are hardened with security features like ACLs, DHCP snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), IP source guard, and port security to prevent internal attacks.
* **Hosts:** End-user devices (laptops, PCs) must be secured with antivirus/antimalware software and Host Intrusion Protection System features.

### Wide Area Network (WAN)

WANs connect geographically distant sites, often over the public internet. The primary security challenge is protecting data in motion as it travels between sites.

* **Use Case:** For a company like NexusAI with clients on multiple continents, a secure WAN is critical. They must ensure that the sensitive patient data moving between a hospital in Europe and their private AI cluster is fully protected.
* **Solution:** Network security professionals use secure edge devices, like an ASA firewall, to establish secure VPN tunnels between the main corporate site and various other destinations. This creates a private, encrypted pathway over the public internet.

### Data Center

Data centers are centralized facilities used to store sensitive or proprietary data. Their security is paramount and uniquely focuses on both digital and physical threats.

* **Digital Security:** Data centers are connected to corporate sites using high-security VPN technology with ASA devices and integrated data center switches.
* **Physical Security:** Because the servers are physically consolidated, physical security is just as critical as digital security. This is divided into two areas:
    * **Outside Perimeter Security:** Includes on-premise security guards, fences, gates, continuous video surveillance, and security breach alarms.
    * **Inside Perimeter Security:** Includes continuous video surveillance, electronic motion detectors, security traps, and biometric access and exit sensors.
* **Environmental Security:** Beyond malicious threats, data centers are protected from environmental hazards with redundant power (UPS), HVAC systems, fire alarms, and sprinklers to protect equipment and ensure uptime.

### SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) Network

Security for SOHO environments is simpler but still relies on a layered approach.

* A consumer-grade wireless router often provides integrated firewall capabilities and secure wireless connections.
* Wireless connections are secured using WPA2 data encryption technology.
* A hardened Layer 2 switch with features like port security connects wired devices.
* Individual hosts are protected with antivirus and antimalware software.

*A typical SOHO setup with a wireless router, a secured Layer 2 switch, and both wired and wireless hosts.*

## Securing the Evolving & Virtualized Network

The nature of our networks is changing. The rise of virtualization, cloud computing, and mobile devices has dissolved the traditional network border, creating new challenges and requiring new security paradigms.

### Cloud & Virtualization Security

It's important to distinguish between virtualization and cloud computing:

* **Virtualization** separates the operating system from the hardware, allowing multiple OS instances to run on a single physical machine.
* **Cloud Computing** separates the application from the hardware and is built upon the foundation of virtualization.

While efficient, virtual machines (VMs) in data centers are prone to unique, targeted attacks:

* **Hyperjacking:** An attacker could hijack the VM hypervisor (the software controlling the VMs) and use it to attack other devices.
* **Instant On Activation:** When a dormant VM is brought online, its security policies may be outdated, creating a security vulnerability.
* **Antivirus Storms:** This operational issue occurs when all VMs on a host try to download antivirus updates simultaneously, overwhelming the system's resources.

### The Borderless Network & BYOD

The days of a clearly defined office network are over. With smartphones and tablets, users access corporate resources from anywhere on any device. This trend, known as **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**, has led to the development of the **Borderless Network** concept.

To manage this, organizations rely on **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** features to enforce security policies on devices they don't own.

| MDM Feature | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Encryption** | MDM features can ensure that only devices that support data encryption and have it enabled can access the network and content. |
| **PIN Enforcement** | Enforcing a PIN lock is the first and most effective step in preventing unauthorized access to a device. |
| **Data Wipe** | A lost or stolen device can be remotely wiped (fully or partially) by the user or an administrator via the MDM. |
| **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** | DLP prevents authorized users from doing careless or malicious things with critical data. |
| **Jailbreak/Root Detection** | MDM can detect when a device's security has been bypassed (jailbreaking/rooting) and immediately restrict its access to the network or assets. |
