# Quiz 2

**Question 1: Network engineer defined a local user account with a secret password on router RA for use with SSH. Which three additional steps are required to configure RA to take only encrypted SSH connections? (Choose three.)**
1.  **Configure an IP domain name:** The router needs a domain name to generate the required RSA keys. Command: `ip domain-name <your-domain.com>`
2.  **Generate RSA keys:** These keys are used to encrypt the SSH session. Command: `crypto key generate rsa`
3.  **Enable SSH on the VTY lines:** Configure the virtual terminal lines to accept SSH connections and use the local user database for login. Commands: `line vty 0 4`, `transport input ssh`, `login local`

---

**Question 2: Why is the `secret` password command preferred over the `password` password command?**

The `secret` command stores the password as a **hashed value** (using MD5 or stronger algorithms), which is a one-way function and cannot be easily reversed. The `password` command stores the password in plaintext or a simple, reversible encryption, which is not secure.

**Question 3: What command DHCP pool that uses number of DHCP 30 clients addresses available on an ASA?**

To create a DHCP pool for 30 clients on a Cisco ASA, you need to define an address range. For example, to provide 30 addresses on the `inside` interface:
`dhcpd address 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.39 inside`

---

**Question 4: Refer to the exhibit. Based on the security levels of the interfaces on ASA1, what traffic will be given on the interfaces?**

Based on the image, the ASA uses a security level rule: **Traffic is allowed to flow from a higher security level to a lower security level by default.**
* Traffic from **LAN (100)** to **DMZ (50)** is **allowed**.
* Traffic from **LAN (100)** to **Internet (0)** is **allowed**.
* Traffic from **DMZ (50)** to **Internet (0)** is **allowed**.
* All traffic from a lower level to a higher level (e.g., Internet to LAN) is **denied** by default.

**Question 5: In Cisco router device to support local authentication, what we need configure?**

You need to enable the AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) framework and set the default login method to use the local user database.
1.  `aaa new-model`
2.  `aaa authentication login default local`

---

**Question 6: Which IPS signature trigger type is based on a defined profile of normal network activity?**

This is an **anomaly-based** (or behavior-based) signature. The IPS learns what normal traffic looks like and triggers an alarm when it detects activity that deviates from that baseline.

---

**Question 7: Which type of firewall occurs when NORMAL traffic triggers an alarm?**

This is called a **False Positive**. It's an alert that incorrectly indicates malicious activity when the traffic is actually legitimate.

---

**Question 8: What security preventive measure is effective for avoiding CAM table overflow attacks?**

**Port Security**. This feature on a switch can be used to limit the number of MAC addresses that can be learned on a specific port. If an attacker tries to flood the port with fake MAC addresses, port security can shut down the port.

---

**Question 9: What is the main reason the use of the Diffie-Helman in network security?**

The main reason is to provide a method for **secure key exchange**. It allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure network without ever sending the key itself. This shared key is then used for symmetric encryption (like AES).

---

**Question 10: Choose ONE (1) statement of asymmetric encryption algorithms is true.**

It uses a pair of keys for communication: a **public key**, which can be shared with anyone, and a **private key**, which is kept secret.

---

**Question 11: Which type of encryption algorithm uses public and private keys to provide CIA?**

**Asymmetric encryption** (also known as public-key cryptography).

---

**Question 12: Which transform set gives the best protection in the firewall?**

The best protection comes from using the strongest modern algorithms. A transform set combining **AES-256 for encryption and SHA for hashing** would be considered very strong. For example: `esp-aes-256 esp-sha-hmac`.

---

**Question 13: Which statement truly describes a functionality of IPsec?**

IPsec is a framework of protocols that operates at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** to secure IP communications by providing confidentiality (encryption), integrity (hashing), and authentication.

---

**Question 14: Which algorithm below picture provide data integrity?**

Based on the image provided (`image_af8042.png`), the command `hash sha` is used. The **SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)** provides data integrity.

---

**Question 15: Which answer below mentioning a VPN?**

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that creates a **secure, encrypted tunnel** over a public network (like the Internet) to connect a user or site to a private network.

---

**Question 16: Choose the correct type of tool is used to divert and confuse the hacker?**

A **Honeypot**. It is a decoy system designed to be an attractive target, distracting attackers from real assets and allowing defenders to study their methods.

---

**Question 17: What will happen after RSA keys are created on a Cisco router to prepare for secure device management?**

The **SSH server is automatically enabled** on the router, making it ready to accept secure connections.

---

**Question 18: Which one the main characteristic of worm malware?**

Its ability to **self-replicate and spread** across networks independently, without needing any human interaction (like opening a file).

---

**Question 19: I received this encrypted message using Vigenere : Myxjcqihnqsqk4sqij and using ILOVESUNWAY key**

The decrypted message is **ENJOY YOUR QUIZ**. (The `4sqij` at the end appears to be a typo or corruption in the original ciphertext).

---

**Question 20: Using Cyclic Redundancy Check compute data 1001101 and identify 3 additional bits required for error checking using divisor value 1101.**

The 3 additional bits (the CRC remainder) required for error checking are **111**.

---

**Question 21: What is a behaviour of a Trojan horse as it relates to network attack?**

A Trojan horse **disguises itself as legitimate software**. An unsuspecting user runs the program, which then executes its hidden malicious function, such as installing a backdoor for the attacker.

---

**Question 22: Select ONE features of a DMZ zone.**

A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a perimeter network that **hosts public-facing servers** (like web and email servers) and keeps them isolated from the secure internal LAN.

---

**Question 23: Select correct facts of Cisco IOS Zone-Based Policy Firewall activity.**

By default, traffic between interfaces that are in the **same security zone is permitted**. Traffic between interfaces in **different zones is denied** until a policy is explicitly applied to allow it.

---

**Question 24: When dynamic Network Address Translation on an Adaptive Security Appliance is configured, what two input must be specified by network objects?**
1.  The group of **real (internal) IP addresses** that need to be translated.
2.  The group of **mapped (public) IP addresses** that the internal addresses will be translated into.

---

**Question 25: For AAA server to handle RADIUS authentication. Choose two features are required in RADIUS authentication? (Choose two.)**
1.  It **combines authentication and authorization** as a single process.
2.  It **only encrypts the password** field within the Access-Request packet; the rest of the packet is sent in plaintext.

---

**Question 26: What action can a network engineer take to mitigate the VLAN hopping attacks? (Choose TWO)**
1.  **Set user-facing ports to static access mode** (`switchport mode access`) to disable DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol).
2.  Change the **native VLAN on trunk links to an unused VLAN ID** and avoid using the default VLAN 1.

---

**Question 27: When Zone-Based Policy Firewall is being configured via Command Line Interface, which step must be taken after zones have been created? (Choose TWO)**
1.  **Define a class-map** to classify and identify the specific traffic you want to control.
2.  **Create a policy-map** to define what action (e.g., inspect, drop, pass) should be taken on the traffic identified by the class-map.

---

**Question 28: When a Zone-Based Policy Firewall is configured, which two actions can be used to a traffic class? (Choose two.)**

The three primary actions are `inspect`, `drop`, and `pass`. Two common actions are:
1.  **Inspect:** Performs stateful packet inspection, allowing return traffic automatically.
2.  **Drop:** Silently discards the traffic.

---

**Question 29: What are 3 areas of router security required to be maintained to protect an edge router in the network perimeter? (Choose three.)**
1.  **Secure the Management Plane:** Use strong passwords, SSH instead of Telnet, AAA, and logging.
2.  **Secure the Control Plane:** Use routing protocol authentication and control plane policing to protect the CPU from DoS attacks.
3.  **Secure the Data Plane:** Use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to filter traffic passing through the router.

---

**Question 30: An network engineer create a local user account with a secret password on router APU for use with SSH. List the correct steps requires for this process**

Assuming the user account is already created, the next essential steps are:
1.  **Set the router's domain name:** `ip domain-name <domain-name>`
2.  **Generate RSA keys:** `crypto key generate rsa`
3.  **Configure VTY lines for SSH:** `line vty 0 4`, `transport input ssh`, `login local`
